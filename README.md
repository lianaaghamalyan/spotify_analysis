# Spotify Tracks Data Analysis 🎧

This project explores a dataset of over 100,000 Spotify tracks from 125 genres, using various audio features like danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and more.  
The goal was to clean the data, explore interesting patterns, and visualize insights about what makes songs popular, how genres differ, and how features like mood and loudness interact.

## 💡 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, types, and outliers)
- Created custom feature groups (e.g. duration categories, valence levels)
